# HandSim

HandSim is a full-stack application for simulating hand interactions with objects in a 3D environment. It uses a frontend built with React, TypeScript, react-three-fiber (Three.js), and Rapier for physics, and a Python backend leveraging OpenCV and MediaPipe for hand landmark detection. The frontend and backend communicate in real time using WebSockets.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** React, TypeScript, Vite, react-three-fiber (Three.js), Rapier (physics)
- **Backend:** Python, OpenCV, MediaPipe
- **Communication:** WebSockets
- **Styling:** CSS

## 🏗️ Architecture

  ├── src/
  │   ├── Components/      # React components for 3D objects and UI
  │   ├── Hooks/           # Custom React hooks for data fetching and state
  │   ├── Experience.tsx   # Main 3D experience logic (react-three-fiber, Rapier)

  └── main.py              # Python backend server (OpenCV, MediaPipe, WebSockets)
```

- **Frontend** uses react-three-fiber for 3D rendering and Rapier for physics, receiving hand landmark data via WebSockets.
- **Backend** uses OpenCV and MediaPipe to process video frames and extract hand landmarks, sending data to the frontend in real time.
